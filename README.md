# IMC_Calculator
Site hosted on Github: https://joaojoselimacerqueira.github.io/IMC_Calculator/
General: Study project, training how to do a IMC calculator, with interactions.
Technologies: CSS, HTML, JS.

My experience: 
1. I wanted a clean and objective interface to user, where they could just open the app and see straight the spots to calculate their IMC. Because people who look for a site who makes this math, usually already knows what IMC is, so let´s deliver the information they are really looking for. So, after results, the user would see a table with all IMC levels, as a way of get known about where they are and how to change that to theirs objectives. 
2. First, I built HTML initial structure, thinking of everything I would use, link with JS and CSS, and show on my website.
3. So I made JS code, all his logic is after the "calcular" button being clicked, all based in declarations, conditions, one main formula math and a table who communicate with CSS;
4. To finish I did CSS, stylizing the main structure; then what happens after "calcular" button has been clicked, making the answer and table appearing with transitions.
5. It was a fun time.

Learn:
1. It was my first time making connections into tables in these technologies, the logic was not difficult, but I get a little stuck on how to transform logic on programming language to make it happen, hopefully, less than one hour I learned.
2. I got better at DOM manipulation, by practing.
